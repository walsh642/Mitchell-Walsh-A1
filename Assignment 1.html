<h1>Personal Information</h1>

<p>Hi, I’m Mitch Walsh, that’s me pictured above on top of one of the pillars of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. I climbed the bridge a couple of days before that, if you ever get the chance, I recommend it, the view from the top really highlights just how beautiful Sydney harbour is. Sydney is my hometown; I grew up in Georges Hall located in Western Sydney. I attended school there, made friends there and although I’m situated 30 mins away from there now, I still frequent the area to visit childhood friends.
At the age of 17 I began working as an apprentice plumber. I finished my 4-year apprenticeship when I was 21 and have been a tradesman ever since. I have been lucky enough to work on some of Sydney’s most prestigious buildings, one being Barangaroo Towers.
When I turned 18, I was old enough to go to local clubs and RSL clubs, that’s when the game of snooker caught my eye. I remember sitting there watching a bunch of older men playing this game which looked like 8-ball but vastly more complex and on a table 12 feet long by 6 feet wide. I was fascinated about what it was they were trying to achieve with each shot. I began to play amongst them and my love the game grew. I have played ever since, although most clubs are now getting rid of the snooker tables in favour of more poker machines, a painful picture for an adamant snooker fan.</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>

<p>My interest in IT can be traced back to the year 1991. That was the year Terminator 2: Judgement Day was released although I would not have the pleasure of viewing this film for a few years after. Little did I know then that the film would spark an interest in IT for me. I think then I probably didn’t know what IT was, but I thought it was incredible that there were machines programmed to destroy mankind. Fast forward to now, and AI is a reality, thankfully for the greater good of mankind, for now anyway, although some may disagree. The world of AI is a wonderful insight into just how we have come especially in the last 20years. It wasn’t so long ago we were flicking a switch to the awful crunching sound of dial up internet. God forbid if somebody rang the house phone and cut you off when you were in the middle of a teenage conversation on MSN Messenger.
My interest in IT has grown progressively over the years and since undertaking a degree in Finance, I have gotten interest into how IT is used in the finance industry for programming algorithmic trading bots, stock screeners, economic indicators, news scanners and the list goes on. It seems the world of investing is quickly becoming the case of robot’s vs robots.</p>

<h3>Personal Profile</h3>

<p>After taking these tests, I am an introverted individual who is goal orientated and hard working to achieve my visions. This affects my working amongst groups although I believe my focus to complete tasks will rise above the uncomfortable feelings of communicating with others to get the job done.  I find that it would be best for me to find other group members who are focused hardworking individuals that can present a more extroverted outlook to balance my introvert personality.</p>

<h4>Project Idea</h4>

<p>Overview
My project is called Deck Drone. It is built for the construction industry and is a robotic drone designed to mark out decks on construction sites. Marking out decks involves measuring off gridlines to precisely spot mark a section on the deck in which a penetration will be present after the concrete is poured. It is almost always a 2-person job and involves working in outdoor conditions. What if we could reduce the cost of labour and enhance the safety of workers, Deck Drone does exactly that.</p>

<h5>Motivation</h5>

<p>Performing deck work in construction is labour intensive. Workers are regularly bending over, lifting heavy equipment, working in direct sunlight and cold conditions. Statistics show that 37% of injury claims in construction are related to body stressing (Safe Work AUS). By implementing Deck Drone we can reduce the number of workers required to undertake the task of marking decks, and can further increase the safety and wellbeing of the worker. I have worked the construction industry for 16 years and I know the impact a robotic drone can have on reducing labour cost, and workers safety.</p>

<h6>Description</h6>

<p>Before we can see the benefits of Deck Drone, lets first understand the process of marking out decks. I am specifically going to explain the process of how a plumbing trade would perform this as I myself am a qualified plumber with many years’ experience in construction.
The deck is an area of the site that has been formed with timbers or metal decking in preparation for a concrete pour. As we know, building aren’t just slabs of concrete, they have bathrooms, kitchens, laundries, and other areas which may require basins, toilets, sinks, floor waste etc. All these require to be installed with pipes for drainage of waste. This is where fire collars are placed. A fire collar allows for pipe to be cast into the slab whilst protecting the upper and lower-level floors if a fire was to occur. The image below is of a deck made from metal, and you can see the blue and green style fire collars in place.</p>


<p>ll these collars need to be placed in a specific location to where they are required eg bathroom area. As each collar has a specific location, the worker must read the provided plans and measure off gridlines which are marked out around the outer perimeter of the deck to acquire the location of the collars. This needs to be done for every collar, and some decks may have over 100 collars to mark out and place into position.
Deck Drone can automate this entire process and can be performed with only 1 worker. Deck Drone works by placing a marker at each corner of the deck. For simplicity we will say our deck is a rectangle, so we have 1 marker at each corner. These markers are signals which identify the location of each other thus creating a perimeter. This information is uploaded to the drone, and it now has an area in which it can operate.
The building plans displaying the location of each collar is uploaded to Deck Drone. The software then syncs the building plans to the perimeter captured using the signal markers. Now the worker is ready to run Deck Drone. The worker who can now simply sit in the shade with a laptop begins to operate Deck Drone. Each collar’s location is placed into a list on the software, and the worker simply attaches the collar to the drone. The worker then presses enter on the software and the drone delivers the collar to its exact location. The drone places the collar in position and staples it down into place, then returning to base to be reloaded with another collar. This process repeats until all collars are installed.</P>

<h7>Tools and Technologies</h7>

<p>This project requires tools and technologies which can produce the desired outcome of perimeter scanning and drone delivery. I believe this project requires a drone capable of being programmed to identify and operate within a set perimeter. It also needs to be durable enough to with stand outdoor conditions and have the efficiency to carry lightweight collars while in flight. The project will also require signal towers to communicate with each other and have the capability of measuring distance and scan landscape. The signal towers must not be excessively heavy or tall as they need to be manual carried to site area. A tower capable of being telescopic would be ideal.</p>

<h8>Skills Required</h8>

<p>The skills which would be required to make this project a reality would be software programming skills. After researching the programming of drones, I feel python language would be a key programming language needed to program the drone. Cloud computing skills would be necessary to create deck drone software so users can upload building plans for syncing with the perimeter identified by the signal towers.</p>

<h9>Outcome</h9>

<p>If this project was successful, it would impact the construction industry by reducing labour cost and enhancing the safety and wellbeing of workers. It would be used throughout thousands of works sites and has the potential to evolve the entire industry into adapting more autonomous and robotic systems onto construction sites. The way the construction industry has performed tasks has relatively been unchanged for more than 100 hundred years. This system is the start in reducing body stress injuries of workers and performing tasks with more accuracy.</p>
